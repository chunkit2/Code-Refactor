# Code-Refactor

## Purpose
The puropse of this project was to code refactor the horiseon website so that it follows accessibility standards. Some problems in the original code included a unorganzied structure and missing codes. I was able to clean the structure up by breaking down the site into sections as opposed to the original format which was a bunch of divs within divs. A couple of the links were also not navigating and I was able to fix that by adding an id tag. I learned a lot about the importance of having a clean radable code in this project and will use this clean struture as a standard in my future projects.
